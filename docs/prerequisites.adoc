You can proceed to {uri-instructions}[creating the cluster] if you have already done these.

== Identity and Access Management Rights

The Terraform user must have the permission to:

. manage dynamic groups (instance_principal and KMS integration)
. manage cluster-family in compartment
. manage virtual-network-family in compartment
. manage instance-family in compartment

== Install Terraform

Start by installing Terraform and configuring your path.

=== Download Terraform

1. Open your browser and navigate to the {uri-terraform-download}[Terraform download page]. You need version 1.0.0+.

2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system

3. Extract the the contents of compressed file and copy the terraform binary to a location that is in your path (see next section below)

=== Configure path on Linux/macOS

1. Open a terminal and type the following:

+
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo mv /path/to/terraform /usr/local/bin

Follow the steps below to configure your path on Windows:

. Click on 'Start', type 'Control Panel' and open it
. Select System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
. Select System variables > PATH and click 'Edit'
. Click New and paste the location of the directory where you have extracted the terraform.exe
. Close all open windows by clicking OK
. Open a new terminal and verify terraform has been properly installed

=== Testing Terraform installation

1. Open a terminal and test:

+
[source,bash]
----
terraform -v
Terraform v1.0.3
----

== Generate API keys

Follow the documentation for generating keys on {uri-oci-keys}[OCI Documentation].

== Upload your API keys

Follow the documentation for uploading your keys on {uri-oci-keys-upload}[OCI Documentation].

Note the fingerprint.

== Create an OCI compartment

Follow the documentation for {uri-oci-compartment}[creating a compartment].

== Obtain the necessary OCIDs

The following OCIDs are required:

. Compartment OCID
. Tenancy OCID
. User OCID

Follow the documentation for obtaining the tenancy and user ids on {uri-oci-ocids}[OCI Documentation].

To obtain the compartment OCID:

1. Navigate to Identity > Compartments
2. Click on your Compartment
3. Locate OCID on the page and click on 'Copy'

If you wish to encrypt Kubernetes secrets with a key from {uri-oci-kms}[OCI KMS], you also need to create {uri-oci-managing-vaults}[a vault] and {uri-oci-managing-keys}[a key] and obtain the key id.

== Configure OCI Policy for OKE

Follow the documentation for {uri-oci-oke-policy}[to create the necessary OKE policy].
