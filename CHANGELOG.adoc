* Added support for VCN native endpoint for Kubernetes
** Added a subnet for control plane (#270)

=== Changes

* Updated permissions required in documentation (#292)

Custom route rules will make hybrid deployment easier to manage.

* Fixed incorrect namespace issue when creating secret for OCIR (#267)
* Narrow permissions for kubeconfig file

=== Deletions
